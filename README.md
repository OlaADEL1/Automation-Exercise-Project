+**Project Description**

Automation Exercise is a website designed for practicing test automation.<br />
In this project I used Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM), to automate the test cases for this website.<br />
It can be used during regression tests or after the deployment of any feature to make sure that it didn't affect older modules.
